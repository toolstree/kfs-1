Compilation

Build System
------------

KFS need to be build using a cross compiler. In order to achieve this we use docker, so that the end user do not have
manually build one.

|

.. figure:: build_system.svg
    :class: with-border

    Compilation is done using docker, some tests are run natively on the host machine


Compiling the kernel
--------------------

Due to the build system compiling is quite easy, you will need:


#. GNU Make
#. CMake
#. A compiler of your choice
#. Docker

|

.. figure:: makefile_targets_architecture.svg
    :class: with-border

    Makefile targets architecture

|

.. figure:: makefile_targets_flowchart.svg

    Makefile targets flowchart

All
"""

This will compile the kernel, an iso and the documentation

.. code-block:: bash

    make

ISO
"""

This will only build the iso

.. code-block:: bash

    make docker-build-iso

Tests
"""""

This will compile and run the tests

.. code-block:: bash

    make test
